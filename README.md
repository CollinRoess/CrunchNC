CrunchNC is a service currently in development for manufacturers that need fast, optimized CNC programming.

Currently, the idea is to use a genetic algorithm to generate the most optimal G-Code, given a CAD file input (currently IGES only)
with the end goal being that this is then used to further train an AI (pick a flavor. I'm making this up as I go.) by example, and then cloud-hosted as some kind of SaaS thing.
